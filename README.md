# NKU Project Repo

Collab

- This application will allow users to sign up and either create a new "group" or join an existing one.

- Each group will be private to only it's members. The group members will be able to share inforation, collaberate on
various projects or ideas.

- The only way to join a group is by requesting an invitation code from the creator. How you obtain this code will be up to the user, but they will need it to view the groups page and join in the fun.

- Collab will provide a calendar feature, comment/discussion section, a list of members that are currently present on the site, to enable live chat. 

- A single user account can only be mapped to one group. You will have the option to leave group, instead of deleting the account if you choose to join another.
